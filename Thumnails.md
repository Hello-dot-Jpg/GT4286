# Game thumbnail images

The thumbnail images for the installed roms are stored in the /roms/{emu}/image directory

Fot example: **/roms/GBA/image** for game boy advanced thumbnails 

The images do not appear to need to be a specific resolution only that they are jpgs

The image file needs to match the rom file name for it to be displayed 

For example: **mvsc.zip -> mvsc.jpg**

*Interestingly there are usually are quite a few more thumbnails then there are ROMs which perhaps gives us some insight on what the original Rom set would have been for this device
For example the GBA image folder contains 1368 items while there are only 164 GBA roms provided*
